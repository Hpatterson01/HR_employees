Overview:

When it comes to businesses, They need to worry about turnover. Due to the potentially high cost that the company will have to take on or the money that the company can lose. I will determine which factors contribute to employee turnover and make a prediction on which employees the company should invest in or not. In order to prevent turnover costs. 

P.S - The numbers I used to further my analysis was just from google when it comes to an average of cost in regards to employee turnover
